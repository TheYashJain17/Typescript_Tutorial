/*In this file we gonna understand the importance of alias , Alias means making a type.

Suppose we have multiple variables and all of them have same types.

For ex: See Below Code.*/
let a = 10;
let b = '20';
let c = undefined;
/*Now by using the type we made , we can see that how much our code is clean and readable and now
we dont have to write the same piece of code again and again and
thats how we use the alias.*/
