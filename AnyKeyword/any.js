"use strict";
// In this file we are seeing the use of any keyword.
/*Any means we can put any data inside that variable we want to ,
Like if we know that the data which is coming inside the variable is number so we will make the variable
of number type , similar case is with string , But when we dont know what type of data is coming into
our variable in that case we cannot define the type of variable ,
So here comes the use of any keyword , when we made the variable of any type we can put any type of data
we want to like number , string or boolean anything.

Below is the example of variable made with any keyword , here we can see that we are storing number inside
data variable which is of any type , so in next line we are storing string value inside it and still we are
not getting any error.
This is the advantage of using any keyword and remember to use this any keyword very cautiously otherwise
we can make some serious problems inside our code.*/
let data0 = 10;
data0 = "hello";
// Similarly if we want to make an array with the help of any keyword then we can do with this like this
let data1 = [10];
// or
let data2 = [10];
