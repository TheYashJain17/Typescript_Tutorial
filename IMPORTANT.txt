                                TYPESCRIPT


Typescript is the upgraded version of the javascript as there are some chances of errors inside the normal
javascript as we could asign a string at the place of number.

For ex - we could write '10' instead of 10 and javscript wouldnt give us any error as it is okay For
javascript.

And these types of errors could happen when we are working on a big project and sometimes mistakenly
we provide the string instead of number or any other error of this type can happen.

So to prevent these types of error Typescript has been introduced as whenver we gonna do these type of errors
Typescript will gonna warn us that we are doing the wrong thing and correct your mistake.

It is not a good practice to define type of every variable again and again , we should depend upon on 
Inference property of typescript which automatically detects the type of the variable , so we should 
depend upon that rather than defining type of the variable again and again.
See Inference folder for better understanding.


So To convert the Typescript file into javascript file we have to write 
tsc then filename inside the cosole.

And remember not to open both the files(ts and js) together otherwise we will get an error , just open them
separately and our error will br gone.

If there is any error inside our ts file then our ts file will not gonna compile.

when we will get the compiled js file then the data inside of js file will be absoulutely same as our
normal javascript as we wouldnt see all the things which we wrote inside our Typescript file
as those things are only limited to Typescript file and not the javascript file.
